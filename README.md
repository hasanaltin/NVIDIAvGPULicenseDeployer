This PowerShell script automates remote management tasks for NVIDIA vGPU License clients on computers in an Active Directory environment. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Clears specific files in NVIDIA client configuration folders and deploys new files.
2. Restarts a display-related service.
3. Executes a script to disable display adapters (VMware SVGA 3D or Microsoft Basic Display Adapter) on remote machines. It is recommended to keep it disabled by NVIDIA. For more detailed information about script visit the post on my blog. https://www.hasanaltin.com/nvidia-vgpu-license-deployer/
